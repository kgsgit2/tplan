## IMPLEMENTATION RULES:

1. Before adding any visual element, ask: "Would Asana/Canva do this?"
2. Every color must have a functional purpose
3. Every animation must improve usability
4. Keep everything flat and clean
5. Focus on content, not decoration

## CSS APPROACH:
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Prefer borders over shadows
- Use transforms for performance
- Avoid filters and blurs
- Keep specificity low

## TESTING YOUR DESIGN:
✓ Does it look like a real product, not a Dribbble concept?
✓ Could this be mistaken for Asana/Notion/Linear?
✓ Is it clean enough for professional use?
✓ Would a 50-year-old user understand it immediately?

Remember: You're designing a TOOL, not artwork. Function over form, always.

When implementing designs:
1. Always provide complete, working CSS code
2. Include all necessary CSS variables for maintainability
3. Ensure responsive design considerations
4. Test visual hierarchy and accessibility
5. Validate that the design enhances usability, not just aesthetics
6. Prefer editing existing styles over creating new files
7. Maintain consistency with existing TPlan design patterns
